## Goals

For making some attempt currently I am working to improve one of the mangrove classification tools so it can be in an acceptable state for regular use. Some of the changes that are currently being developed include:
- Perceptron which is a linear classification model of two-class classification.
- Logistic regression which is a discriminant model, which learns the probability of belonging to each category under given feature conditions.


The explanation and implementation process are detailed in the demo.
